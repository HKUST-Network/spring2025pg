policies:
  - You have free 4 late days in total.
  - You can use late days for assignments. A late day extends the deadline 24 hours.
  - Once you have used all 4 late days, the penalty is 20% for each additional late day (5 days later there will be no points).
  - Remember that any questions should go to Piazza instead of emailing TAs or the professor.
